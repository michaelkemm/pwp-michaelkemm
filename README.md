### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10008; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

A little more detail is needed in the Persona, and your Use Case is missing. Based on what you have here, it looks like you will be creating a website for yourself to attract freelance clients. It would help you to create at least a minimal use case to guide your development, and a more well defined Persona based upon the types of clients you are looking to work with. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Your HTML code looks great. Right now, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). If you add a Use Case, and a more well-defined Persona, I will pass this Milestone at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)
