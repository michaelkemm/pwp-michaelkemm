### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10008; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

A little more detail is needed in the Persona, and your Use Case is missing. Based on what you have here, it looks like you will be creating a website for yourself to attract freelance clients. It would help you to create at least a minimal use case to guide your development, and a more well defined Persona based upon the types of clients you are looking to work with. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Your HTML code looks great. Right now, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). If you add a Use Case, and a more well-defined Persona, I will pass this Milestone at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Nice job on the wireframes. This is a decent plan on which to begin building your site in HTML/Bootstrap/CSS. Your sitemap, content strategy, and interaction flow are all simple and to the point - so this works. Don't forget that a simple contact form is required, so add one to your contact area. We'll be using PHP and Swiftmailer to power that.

Think about possibly adding some technical details to your work samples. For instance: technology/programming languages, role on the project, date, etc. Pop-up modal windows or gallery functionality can easily be included, or you can just add a bit of text to the page. Your choice, this is not mandatory.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to start development on your PWP.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
